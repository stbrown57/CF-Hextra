Web development includes a number of technologies and process to effectively produce a workable site. Visual and ergonomic design is important for any web site, after all, this is a visual medium. Once a design have been produced HTML coding has to be written to facilitate the design goal. The web has been evolving for a long time and many tools and systems have been developed to make this process more efficient. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are styling attributes that are assigned to HTML code to provide a consistent visual and operational style. There are literally thousands of CSS libraries available both for a cost and open sources. I image the CSS are implementing primitives in the [browse's rendering engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine) built to [W3C maintained standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).
